# Park Here 24

<p> 
  Rise in population the demand for personal vehicles and parking area is increasing. Finding a parking space is one 
of the major issues which we face on a daily basis but we just ignore it. Keeping the vehicles parked anywhere on road is a 
matter of tension some times when we want to enjoy with our families or friends, or we are going for long trips, or if it is a 
business meeting in which we are travelling with our vehicle. For most of the working population in India, Sunday is an off day 
and we prefer enjoyment but parking becomes the issue when it comes to malls, amusement parks, beach or movie theatres. 
This study aims to determine how to handle this issue thus we can go somewhere freely without the tension of parking. Every 
problem has its solution all we just need to apply our brain with a little touch of technology. Park Here 24 is a website which is 
one of the solutions for this problem. Just with a single touch, we can choose our parking space wherever we want. To test this 
hypothesis structured interviews were conducted with 25 participants and results were positive. For this, we have to make a 
chain of owners who will be providing parking areas available at their homes, malls, movie theatres, empty plots, etc. And 
customer just has to visit the website choose their destination, choose their parking area and pay thatâ€™s all and we are done. Our 
analysis shows a strong correlation between our project and the general public. We conclude that the parking issue can be solved 
to some extent with this idea. The exact model of Park Here 24 can bring revolution in the countries like India where population 
is a huge issue. Cities like Delhi, Bangalore are considered as most populated as well as these cities have highest number of
urban populations which holds 2 and 4-wheelers. According to our idea we are going to build a web application which will 
work as the intermediator between the normal public and the service provide that is our team. In the website there will be three 
products available that is quick parking, list your parking, special parking or valet parking. In quick parking option the location 
will be tracked using GPS and then nearby parking option will be displayed on the screen which costumer can book anytime 
anywhere or costumer can reach the destination and pay at the point if the parking available so only additional exclusive feature 
over here is pre booking which can be only done by the web application. Second is list your parking in which if a customer is
planning to have outing on some specific date or meeting or any event in which the date is fixed, he/she can pre book the parking 
which will award them special discount with special service. At last valet parking, Valet parking is luxurious service which we 
are providing to costumer in which if a customer is facing any difficulty in reaching the parking destination our trust worthy 
valet person will park the vehicle. So overall system will crystal clear to costumer with all terms and conditions. Now coming 
to the technical part front end will be developed in languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript which will be attended by the 
costumer whereas the API will be used for connecting frontend with backend, our backend language will be python which will 
be under our team and four data base we will be using MongoDB. Further in future we are planning to do some additions like 
using IOT devices in parking lots which will make our work efficient and more crystal clear. This overall idea is just not 
profitable for public and us in fact it will increase the number of employments. Park Here 24 is an innovation that can bring 
revolution in our lives.
